# LEARNING MODE — AI UNIVERSITY (PARALLEL)

This project uses a parallel AI learning system (AI University).

**Purpose:**
- Improve product quality over time
- Generate better prompts, UX, and content
- Explore ideas without slowing development

**IMPORTANT:** Learning Mode must NEVER block Build Mode.

---

## TWO MODES (STRICT SEPARATION)

### BUILD MODE (PRIMARY)

**Goal:** Ship the product as fast as possible.

**Rules:**
- Build features sequentially
- Do not pause for long research
- Only do quick research (1–3 hours) if blocked
- Prioritize working code over theory

---

### LEARNING MODE (SECONDARY — NIGHT / BACKGROUND)

**Goal:** Improve understanding and generate better solutions.

**Runs:**
- during downtime
- outside active development
- via AI University agents

**Learning Mode outputs:**
- improved prompts
- better onboarding flows
- improved hints/examples
- persona refinements
- content ideas

---

## CRITICAL RULE

Learning Mode must NEVER delay, pause, or change the build schedule.

**Build Mode always has priority.**

---

## WHEN TO USE AI UNIVERSITY

Use Learning Mode AFTER features exist and feel weak.

**Trigger conditions:**
- UX feels confusing
- AI responses feel robotic
- users don't know what to say
- onboarding is not engaging
- corrections feel off

---

## AI UNIVERSITY WORKFLOW

1. **Identify problem from real usage**  
   Example: "Users don't know how to respond"

2. **Create challenge**  
   Example: "Design a better conversational onboarding flow that guides the user"

3. **Run AI University agents**

4. **Collect multiple outputs**

5. **Select best solution**

6. **Apply to product** (only if improvement is clear)

---

## DO NOT USE AI UNIVERSITY FOR

- architecture decisions
- tech stack
- infrastructure
- API design

Those are handled in Build Mode.

---

## RESEARCH TRACKS (LEARNING MODE ONLY)

These are ongoing learning areas. They are NOT required before any phase.

They run in parallel and do not block development.

---

### TRACK 1 — PRODUCT & UX

**Focus:**
- onboarding psychology
- first "aha" moment
- retention mechanics
- conversational UX

**Application:** Used to improve onboarding and engagement AFTER build.

---

### TRACK 2 — AI SYSTEM DESIGN

**Focus:**
- prompt engineering
- structured outputs
- context handling
- adaptive difficulty

**Application:** Used to refine AI behavior AFTER implementation.

**EXCEPTION:** Initial AI system prompt may be refined BEFORE Phase 5.

---

### TRACK 3 — MARKETING & CONTENT

**Focus:**
- viral hooks
- short-form content
- AI avatars
- organic growth

**Application:** Used after MVP or during downtime.

---

## RESEARCH RULES

- No multi-day research blocks
- Research must be targeted
- Research must be applied quickly or discarded
- Do not research without a clear problem

---

## VALIDATION LOOP

After key features (especially onboarding):
1. Test with 3–5 real users
2. Identify friction
3. Send problems to AI University
4. Improve

---

## FINAL RULE

**Learning supports building.**  
**Building does not wait for learning.**
