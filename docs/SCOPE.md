# SALITA — AI TAGALOG TUTOR 🇵🇭 (MVP SCOPE)

**Project Type:** AI Language Learning App  
**Target Market:** ~4 million Filipino Americans (second-generation losing Tagalog)  
**Core Innovation:** Conversation-first learning (no lessons, flashcards, or quizzes)

---

## THE PROBLEM

~4 million Filipino Americans live in the US. Second-generation Filipino Americans are losing Tagalog at an alarming rate. There is no high-quality app that helps them reconnect with the language through real conversation and cultural context.

Existing language apps (Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone):
- Do not support Tagalog well or at all
- Teach like textbooks (flashcards, drills, boring)
- Do not reflect real Filipino conversation (family phrases, slang, Taglish)

---

## THE SOLUTION

Salita is an AI conversation partner that teaches Tagalog through real conversation.

Core idea: **"Learn Tagalog by talking."**

There are:
- No lessons
- No flashcards
- No quizzes

Users learn by chatting with a Filipino AI tutor that:
- speaks naturally
- guides them on what to say
- corrects gently
- explains cultural context

---
